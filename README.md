## Project Description
This note-taker web app, Duly Noted, will allow anyone to title and write extensive notes and keep track of tasks, then save them for later reading or deletion. 

### Live Site

This demo shows that you can open previous and create new notes. It also shows the creation of unique IDs using the NPM "[Generate Unique ID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-unique-id)."
